Colors - Black Pumas
I woke up to the morning sky first
Baby blue just like we rehearsed
When I get up off this ground
I shake leaves back down to the brown, brown, brown, 'til I'm clean
Then I walked where I'd be shaded by the trees by a meadow of green
For about a mile I'm headed to town, town, town, in style
With all my favorite colors
All my favorite colors
My sisters and my brothers see them like no other
All my favorite colors
It's good day to be, a good day for me, a good day to see my favorite colors
My sisters and my brothers, they see them like no other
All my favorite colors
Now take me to the otherside
Where the baby blues birds fly
In grey clouds, or white walls, or blue skies we gon' fly, feel alright
Now we gon' woo ooh woo ooh woo ooh ya
They sound like woo ooh woo ooh woo ooh ya
The least I can say I anticipate a homecome parade as we renegade in the morning
All my favorite colors
All my favorite colors
My sisters and my brothers see them like no other
All my favorite colors
